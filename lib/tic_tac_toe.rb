  # and have it return to us the corresponding index of the @board array. Remember that, from the 
  # player's point of view, the board contains spaces 1-9. But the indices in an array start their 
  # count at 0. If the user inputs 5, your method must correctly translate that from the player's

  # the Tic Tac Toe board and checking to see whether or not that position is already occupied. 
  # Note that this method will be running after #input_to_index, so it will be checking index values. 
  # When it is passed the index value for a prospective move, #position_taken? will check to see if 
  # that position on the @board is vacant or if it contains an "X" or an "O". If the position is free, 
  # the method should return false (i.e., "the position is not taken"); otherwise, it will return true.

  # routine:
  # 1. Ask the user for their move by specifying a position between 1-9.
  # 2. Receive the user's input.
  # 3. Translate that input into an index value.
  # 4. If the move is valid, make the move and display the board.
  # 5. If the move is invalid, ask for a new move until a valid move is received.

  # The play method is the main method of the Tic Tac Toe application and is responsible for the game loop.
  # A Tic Tac Toe game must allow players to take turns, checking if the game is over after every turn. 
  # At the conclusion of the game, whether because it was won or ended in a draw, the game should report 
  # to the user the outcome of the game. You can imagine the pseudocode:
  #   until the game is over
  #     take turns
  #   end
  
  #   if the game was won
  #     congratulate the winner
  #   else if the game was a draw
